## About the Organization

**Bharatiyar Tamil Changam (BTC)** is an Indian **non-profit, non-private organization** dedicated to preserving and celebrating Tamil culture and heritage within the community. Named after **Subramania Bharati** — one of the greatest Tamil poets and a fierce advocate for Indian independence, women's rights, and social reform — BTC carries forward his vision of a united, culturally proud community.

The organization serves as a cultural hub where Tamil families and individuals of all backgrounds come together to celebrate the rich traditions of Tamil Nadu through food, dance, music, language, and community service. BTC is entirely volunteer-run and funded through community donations and event contributions.

## Who Was Subramania Bharati?

<div class="btc-section">

**Chinnaswami Subramania Bharati** (1882–1921), popularly known as **Mahakavi Bharati**, was a Tamil poet, journalist, Indian independence activist, and social reformer. He is considered one of the greatest Tamil literary figures of all time. His works broke away from the rigid classical style and brought poetry to the common people.

**Why the organization is named after him:**

- He championed **Tamil pride** and the preservation of Tamil identity and language
- He was a vocal advocate for **women's rights**, social equality, and the end of caste discrimination
- His poems about freedom, courage, and cultural pride continue to inspire millions of Tamils around the world
- He believed in a **united India** that celebrates its diversity — the same values BTC promotes

Some of his most famous works include *"Achamillai Achamillai"* (We Shall Not Fear), *"Senthamizh Naadenum Pothinile"* (In Praise of Tamil Nadu), and *"Pudiya Athhichudi"* — a reimagining of ancient Tamil moral verses for the modern age.

## The Food

No Tamil cultural event is complete without an incredible spread of food. At BTC events, community members come together to prepare **authentic South Indian and Tamil dishes** from scratch. The food is always a highlight — prepared with traditional recipes passed down through generations.

### Dosa

<img class="food-img" src="https://indianambrosia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/masala-dosa-with-sambar-and-chutney.jpg" alt="Masala Dosa served with sambar and coconut chutney">

**Dosa** is one of the most iconic South Indian dishes and a staple at every BTC event. It's a thin, crispy crepe made from a fermented batter of rice and black lentils (urad dal). The fermentation process gives it a slightly tangy flavor and makes it naturally probiotic.

The batter is traditionally ground on a wet grindstone, though modern kitchens use wet grinders. It's spread thin on a hot griddle (tawa) and cooked until golden and crispy. At BTC events you'll find multiple varieties:

| Type | Description | Served With |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Masala Dosa** | Filled with spiced potato and onion filling (masala) | Sambar, coconut chutney, tomato chutney |
| **Plain Dosa** | Crispy and golden, no filling — all about the crunch | Sambar, multiple chutneys |
| **Rava Dosa** | Made with semolina (rava) for extra crispiness, lace-like texture | Coconut chutney, sambar |
| **Mysore Masala Dosa** | Spread with spicy red chutney inside before adding potato filling | Sambar, coconut chutney |
| **Ghee Roast Dosa** | Generously drizzled with ghee (clarified butter) and roasted extra crispy | Sambar, chutneys |

### Idli & Sambar

<img class="food-img" src="https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/idli-recipe-1.jpg" alt="Soft fluffy idlis served with sambar and chutney">

**Idli** is a soft, pillowy steamed rice cake that is one of the most beloved breakfast items in South India. Made from the same fermented rice and lentil batter as dosa, idlis are steamed in special molds and come out fluffy and spongy. They're incredibly light, easy to digest, and naturally gluten-free.

Idlis are always served with **sambar** — a rich, tangy stew made from toor dal (pigeon pea lentils), tamarind, and a blend of vegetables like drumstick, eggplant, and okra, all simmered with a special spice powder. Alongside comes **coconut chutney** — freshly ground coconut with green chilies, ginger, and tempered with mustard seeds and curry leaves.

### Biryani

<img class="food-img" src="https://www.licious.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/chicken-hyderabadi-biryani-01.jpg" alt="Fragrant biryani with spices and herbs">

**Biryani** is a fragrant, layered rice dish that is arguably the most popular dish at any large Indian gathering. It's made by layering long-grain basmati rice with marinated meat (or vegetables for the vegetarian version), fried onions, saffron-infused milk, fresh herbs like mint and cilantro, and a complex blend of whole spices including cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, and bay leaves.

The dish is then sealed and slow-cooked (dum) so the flavors meld together. Each grain of rice absorbs the spices and the meat becomes fall-off-the-bone tender. At BTC celebrations, biryani is often prepared in massive quantities in huge vessels (called **deg**) and it always runs out fast.

**Regional styles you might see:**

- **Hyderabadi Biryani** — rich, spicy, with layers of saffron rice
- **Chettinad Biryani** — Tamil Nadu's own fiery, aromatic version with Chettinad spices
- **Dindigul Biryani** — a Tamil specialty known for its tangy, peppery flavor using seeraga samba rice
- **Vegetable Biryani** — loaded with paneer, peas, carrots, and beans

### Pongal

**Pongal** is both a dish and a festival. The dish **Ven Pongal** (savory pongal) is made with rice and moong dal cooked together with black pepper, cumin, ginger, and cashews tempered in ghee. **Sakkarai Pongal** (sweet pongal) is the sweet version made with jaggery, cardamom, and ghee. During the Pongal festival, the dish is ceremonially cooked in a clay pot until it overflows — the boiling over symbolizes abundance and prosperity.

### Chettinad Chicken

**Chettinad cuisine** is one of the spiciest and most aromatic regional cuisines of Tamil Nadu, originating from the Chettinad region. Chettinad chicken is a fiery curry made with freshly ground spices including kalpasi (stone flower), marathi mokku (dried flower pods), star anise, and an abundance of black pepper and red chilies. It's rich, bold, and pairs perfectly with steamed rice or parotta.

### Sweets & Snacks

Tamil events feature an incredible variety of homemade snacks and desserts. Community members often prepare these at home and bring them to share:

<div class="btc-grid">
  <div class="btc-card">
    <h4>Samosa</h4>
    <p>Crispy, golden pastry pockets filled with spiced potatoes, peas, and sometimes meat. Deep-fried to perfection with a crunchy exterior and soft, flavorful filling inside.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="btc-card">
    <h4>Murukku</h4>
    <p>Crunchy, spiral-shaped savory snacks made from rice flour and urad dal flour, seasoned with cumin and sesame seeds. Pressed through a mold and deep-fried — a Tamil classic.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="btc-card">
    <h4>Payasam / Kheer</h4>
    <p>A rich, creamy dessert made by slow-cooking milk with vermicelli (or rice), sugar, cardamom, saffron, and garnished with cashews and raisins fried in ghee.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="btc-card">
    <h4>Jalebi</h4>
    <p>Bright orange, deep-fried spirals of fermented batter soaked in warm sugar syrup. Crispy on the outside, syrupy on the inside — best eaten fresh and hot.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="btc-card">
    <h4>Mysore Pak</h4>
    <p>A legendary South Indian sweet made from gram flour (besan), ghee, and sugar. It melts in your mouth and has a rich, buttery flavor. A Mysore original that's beloved across Tamil Nadu.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="btc-card">
    <h4>Vada</h4>
    <p>Crispy, golden doughnut-shaped fritters made from ground urad dal. Crunchy on the outside, soft inside. Served with sambar and chutney, or soaked in yogurt as <strong>thayir vada</strong>.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="btc-card">
    <h4>Parotta with Salna</h4>
    <p>Flaky, layered flatbread (not to be confused with paratha) served with a spicy, onion-tomato gravy called salna. A popular street food from Tamil Nadu and a crowd favorite at events.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="btc-card">
    <h4>Filter Coffee</h4>
    <p>No Tamil gathering is complete without <strong>filter kaapi</strong>. Strong, aromatic South Indian coffee brewed through a traditional metal filter, mixed with hot milk and sugar, and poured between two cups to create the signature froth.</p>
  </div>
</div>

## Cultural Dances

Dance is at the heart of Tamil culture. At BTC events, both trained classical dancers and enthusiastic community members perform a variety of dance forms that represent centuries of artistic tradition.

### Bharatanatyam

<div class="dance-section">
  <div>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Bharata_natyam_dancer_medha_s.jpg/400px-Bharata_natyam_dancer_medha_s.jpg" alt="Bharatanatyam dancer in classical pose">
  </div>
  <div>
    <p><strong>Bharatanatyam</strong> is one of the oldest classical dance forms in the world, with origins dating back over <strong>2,000 years</strong> to the temples of Tamil Nadu. It was originally performed as a devotional offering in Hindu temples by specially trained dancers called <em>devadasis</em>.</p>
    <p>The dance form combines three elements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Nritta</strong> — pure rhythmic dance with intricate footwork</li>
      <li><strong>Nritya</strong> — expressive dance using hand gestures (mudras) and facial expressions (abhinaya)</li>
      <li><strong>Natya</strong> — dramatic storytelling through dance</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Dancers wear vibrant silk costumes, ankle bells (salangai/ghungroo), and traditional jewelry. Performances are accompanied by Carnatic music with instruments like the mridangam (drum), veena (string instrument), and flute.</p>
  </div>
</div>

### Folk Dances of Tamil Nadu

Tamil Nadu has a rich tradition of folk dances that are performed during festivals, harvest celebrations, and community events. Unlike classical Bharatanatyam, folk dances are energetic, communal, and meant for everyone to participate in.

<div class="btc-grid">
  <div class="btc-card">
    <h4>Karagattam</h4>
    <p>One of the most visually stunning Tamil folk dances. Performers balance <strong>decorated pots</strong> on their heads while dancing to fast-paced music. The pots are adorned with flowers, and the dancers move with incredible agility without dropping them. Originally performed as a prayer to the rain goddess Mariamman.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="btc-card">
    <h4>Kummi</h4>
    <p>A traditional <strong>group circle dance</strong> performed mainly by women during festivals and celebrations. Dancers stand in a circle and clap their hands rhythmically while moving in sync. It's simple, joyful, and one of the oldest forms of community dance in Tamil culture.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="btc-card">
    <h4>Kolattam (Stick Dance)</h4>
    <p>Dancers hold colorful <strong>wooden sticks</strong> and strike them together in rhythmic patterns while moving in formation. It requires coordination between all dancers as they weave in and out, creating beautiful visual patterns. Often performed during Navaratri.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="btc-card">
    <h4>Mayilattam (Peacock Dance)</h4>
    <p>Performers wear elaborate <strong>peacock costumes</strong> with colorful feathers and dance gracefully, mimicking the movements of a peacock. It's visually spectacular and a favorite among children watching at BTC events.</p>
  </div>
</div>

## Music & Art

### Carnatic Music

**Carnatic music** is the classical music tradition of South India, with a history spanning over 2,000 years. It is one of the oldest and most sophisticated musical systems in the world. At BTC events, you might hear:

- **Vocal concerts** — the voice is the primary instrument in Carnatic music, with singers performing complex ragas (melodic frameworks) and talas (rhythmic cycles)
- **Mridangam** — a double-headed drum that provides the rhythmic foundation
- **Veena** — an ancient stringed instrument considered the queen of Indian instruments
- **Nadaswaram** — a powerful wind instrument traditionally played at temple festivals and weddings
- **Violin** — adapted into Carnatic music and played while seated on the floor

### Famous Carnatic Composers

The "Trinity of Carnatic Music" — **Tyagaraja**, **Muthuswami Dikshitar**, and **Syama Sastri** — composed thousands of devotional songs (kritis) that are still performed today, hundreds of years later.

### Kolam (Rangoli)

**Kolam** is a traditional Tamil art form where intricate geometric patterns are drawn on the ground using rice flour, chalk, or colored powders. Tamil women traditionally draw kolams at the entrance of their homes every morning as a sign of welcome and prosperity. At BTC events, large kolam designs are often created as decorations, and kolam competitions are held for both children and adults.
