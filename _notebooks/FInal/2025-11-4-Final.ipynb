    "At the start of the year, I was completely lost when in this class. I knew nothing about it and honestly felt scared for my grade. I thought I would need private tutors or extra classes just to keep up, and I felt isolated in the class with no one to turn to for help.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What changed everything:**\n",
    "- After forming groups in CSP instead of looking at my classmates as just teamates, I look at them now as close friends\n",
    "- I began understanding fundamental concepts like loops and algorithms through collaboration and practice\n",
    "- Eventually, I reached a point where I could help my friend Shayan when he got stuck, which showed me how far I'd come\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key accomplishments this trimester:**\n",
    "- Created Submodule 1 for our West Coast Journey project\n",
    "- Learned to write algorithms and implement loops\n",
    "- Explained the Python lesson on iterations to other peers\n",
