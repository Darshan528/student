    "\n",
    "### My Coding Journey\n",
    "\n",
    "At the start of the year, I was completely lost when in this class. I knew nothing about it and honestly felt scared for my grade. I thought I would need private tutors or extra classes just to keep up, and I felt isolated in the class with no one to turn to for help.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What changed everything:**\n",
    "- After forming groups in CSP instead of looking at my classmates as just teamates, I look at them now as close friends\n",
    "- I began understanding fundamental concepts like loops and algorithms through collaboration and practice\n",
    "- Eventually, I reached a point where I could help my friend Shayan when he got stuck, which showed me how far I'd come\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key accomplishments this trimester:**\n",
    "- Created Submodule 1 for our West Coast Journey project\n",
    "- Learned to write algorithms and implement loops\n",
    "- Explained the Python lesson on iterations to other peers\n",
    "- Got a book on Python and JavaScript to deepen my understanding on coding\n",
    "\n",
    "### Growth Beyond Coding\n",
    "\n",
    "My presentation skills improved dramatically with help from our Scrum Master, Akhil. He identified specific areas where I needed work and helped me address them:\n",
    "- Making better eye contact with the audience\n",
    "- Speaking louder and more confidently\n",
    "- Understanding that mistakes are part of learning—nothing bad happens if I mess up\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall Transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "I've gone from being scared of coding to genuinely enjoying it and looking forward to learning more. This trimester taught me about GitHub, repositories, and programming fundamentals. Most importantly, I'm now confident in my abilities and proud of how much I've grown as both a coder and a presenter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Night at the Musuem\n",
    "- I had a lot of fun\n",
    "- Amazing to see that so many people have learned to code (CSSE)\n",
    "- I enjoyed presenting my module to the adults\n",
    "- My favorite game was the gambling game\n",
    "- Very crowded\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## If we were given more time to work on this project\n",
    "- I would change the css to be more visually appealing\n",
    "- Add more features to the project\n",
    "- \n",
